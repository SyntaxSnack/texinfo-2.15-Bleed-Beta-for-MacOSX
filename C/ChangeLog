	* makeinfo.c: New version 1.47

	* info.c:(main) If the user speficied the info file to use, and it
	wasn't found, then exit immediately.

	long options.  Other minor cosmetic changes.

Sat May 30 11:52:26 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox@cubit)

	* info.c (show_version_info) New function displays version
	information.  New long option "--version" causes this function to
	be called, and then Info to exit.

Wed May 27 09:52:22 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox@cubit)

	* info.c (dump_current_node) If the output filename is "-", then

	* makeinfo.c (begin_insertion, end_insertion) Do not close
	paragraphs if producing a file with --no-headers.

	* makeinfo.c (begin_insertion) Indentation of multiple paragraphs
	appearing within an @enumerate is only done if the #define
	INDENT_PARAGRAPHS_IN_TABLE is set (not the default).  This makes
	@enumerate paragraph indentation identical to @table and friends.

Sat May 23 19:44:43 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox@cubit)

	* makeinfo.c: New version 1.46.

	Changed `@set' to accept an equal sign followed by a value to
	allow set variables to have values.

	New command `@value{FOO}' inserts the value of the variable FOO.

	@set accepts quoted values of the form: @set FOO="this is a list".
	@ifclear and  @ifset now count the conditionals encountered while
	searching for their respective ends.

	Command line arguments "-Dfoo" and "-Ubar" set and clear foo and
	bar.

	not `+'.

Sat Feb 22 02:15:00 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* makeinfo.c: (begin_insertion) @group does absolutely nothing
	when found inside of an @example.

	* texindex.c: New version 1.45 has cleanups, should compile under
	VMS quietly.

Thu Feb 20 16:21:54 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* makeinfo.c (cm_center) Inhibit output flushing to prevent the
	executed line from disappearing before its length can be
	calculated.

	* makeinfo.c (inhibit_output_flushing, uninhibit_output_flushing)

	find_and_load_file) Two new functions, and modify
	find_and_load_file () to use get_file_info_in_path ().  You can
	now supply multiple `-I<path>' flags to makeinfo in order to
	specify directories which should be searched to find files
	included with @include.

Sat Feb  8 00:06:17 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* makeinfo.c (usage): Update the help message.

	* Makefile.in: Hack kludge to get -traditional into the CFLAGS.  I
	hate auto-configure, and worse, where does it get off deciding for
	me that I want to use a specific compiler simply because I have a
	file called gcc in my PATH?

	* makeinfo.c (new functions):  New functions cm_macro, cm_unmacro,
	add_macro, execute_macro, delete_macro () all implement new @macro
	construct.  This is conditionally compiled with #define HAVE_MACROS.

Fri Feb  7 18:27:45 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* makeinfo.c (cm_center):  Center the line *after* "executing" it.

	* info.c: Remove "true", "false", and "boolean", replacing them
	with 1, 0, and int.

Tue Jan 21 01:18:25 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* makeinfo.c (cm_titlefont) New function does nothing special but
	makes life easier.

Fri Jan 10 16:43:04 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

        * makeinfo.c (cm_code) Increment/decrement in_fixed_width_font
        while processing the text inside of an @code (includes @samp, @file).

Wed Jan  8 02:52:33 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* makeinfo.c: (close_insertion_paragraph) New function gets called
	to close certain types of insertions.  This includes @format,
	@example, etc.  New variable line_already_broken describes the
	state of the output file to close/start_paragraph ().

Tue Jan  7 02:24:10 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* makeinfo.c: (cm_node) Get and remember sectioning commands even
	for those nodes which are not currently defaulting.  Such nodes
	can contain menus whose nodes are defaulted, and we need to know
	the sectioning level of the node containing the menu.

	* makeinfo.c: Removed definitions for "true", "false", and the
	typedef for "boolean".  Changed all code accordingly.  Added
	defines for BRACE_ARGS and NO_BRACE_ARGS to increase readability
	of the CommandTable.

	* makeinfo.c (begin_insertion) Do not
	inhibit_paragraph_indentation for @table and friends.

Mon Jan  6 11:52:36 1992  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

        * makeinfo.c (convert) WHoops!  Remove surrounding whitespace from
        OUTPUT_FILENAME before using.

	* makeinfo.c: (end_insertion) If an @end INSERTION is followed by
	a blank line, then start a new paragraph there, otherwise close
	the current one without a blank line.

	* makeinfo.c: (main, convert) Add code to support -o FILE (+output
	FILE) option.  The output filename generated from this option
	overrides the filename appearing in the @setfilename command.

Mon Dec 23 23:46:42 1991  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* texindex.c: Change POSIX ifdefs to HAVE_UNISTD_H and _POSIX_VERSION.

Wed Dec 18 04:26:02 1991  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* makeinfo.c (end_insertion) Close paragraphs removing last
	inserted newline which comes from @end INSERTION.

	* makeinfo.c (start_paragraph) Do not unconditionally set the
	output column from the desired indentation; use an interim value
	instead and keep in mind that some indentation may have already
	been done.

Fri Dec  6 01:25:09 1991  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* texindex.c: Conditionalize on _AIX (which is predefined) instead
	of AIX, just like makeinfo does.

Sat Nov 23 22:43:05 1991  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* makeinfo.c: (cm_vtable) New command @vtable is just like
	@ftable, but adds an entry to the variable index instead of the
	function index.

Thu Nov 21 00:12:51 1991  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* info.c: #define S_ISREG macro if not defined, and use the
	definition.

Wed Nov 20 01:07:57 1991  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* makeinfo.c: (flush_output) Turn off meta bit on sentence enders
	that were ignored.

Fri Nov  1 01:09:43 1991  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at wookumz.gnu.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile.in: Add texindex.
	* texindex.c: Add more #ifdefs, for VMS and USG.
	(usage): New function.
	(decode_command): Call it if given invalid option or no files.
	Use getopt.

Sat Sep 21 17:02:42 1991  Info Maintainer  (info at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* makeinfo.c: New command @deftypemethod added.

	* makeinfo.c: (cm_cartouche) New function which is ignored in
	makeinfo.

	appear blank.

	* index_add_arg (), close_paragraph (); Call ignore_blank_line ()
	to tell the reader that the previous line disappeared from the
	input stream.  New function ignore_blank_line ().

Tue Sep  3 22:38:18 1991  Info Maintainer  (info at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* makeinfo.c: (cm_footnotestyle, cm_paragraphindent) Fix bogus
	call to get_rest_of_line ().

Tue Jun 11 00:34:12 1991  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* info.c: Fixed SIGWINCH display bugs.  Windows can now be resized
	at will.

Mon Jun 10 11:25:01 1991  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* makeinfo.c New function cm_math () does nothing but accepts
	arguments.

	* makeinfo.c (flush_output) only change the 8th bit for space,
	tab, or newline.  This protects ISO character sets.

	* info.c: opsys_filename (); Return only the names of regular
	files, not directories or block special devices.

	* makeinfo.c (add_char) Fixed bug in filling which could cause 78
	character lines to be filled incorrectly when fill_column was 79.

Tue Jun  4 13:34:57 1991  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* makeinfo.c: Add @paragraphindent and @footnotesytle as
	interactive commands to change default paragraph indentation and

	* @cite now produces `...' instead of ``...''.

Tue Jan 29 16:47:01 1991  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* makeinfo.c: add flushleft, and flushright.
	  (cm_xref): all calls to add_word_args () are now calls to
	  execute_string () so that @code{@@bullet} produces the correct
	  output.  The call to normalize_node_name () from get_xref_token
	  () is removed, since xref now calls execute string.
	  (end_insertion) now sets last_char_was_newline so that no extra
	  indentation can appear on the following text line.

Sun Jan 27 22:32:45 1991  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* makeinfo.c (args_from_string): Hack tokenization to consider a
	command followed immediately by braces to be a single token
	(including the braces and contents of same).	

Thu Jun 28 15:01:51 1990  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* makeinfo.c, info.c, Makefile:  Change SYSV to USG.

Wed Jun 27 12:22:12 1990  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* makeinfo.c: new function cm_today () produces the date in the
	output document.

Wed May 30 13:00:09 1990  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* makeinfo.c (cm_xref) If arguments 4 or 5 are present, then we
	use argument 2 as the node name, unless it is empty, in which case
	we use argument one.  See how easy this is to use?

	* makeinfo.c (many index functions)  Handle code indices by
	inserting @code{} around the index entry item when it is being
	printed.  Keep track of which type of index was used to insert
	this item into the index.

	* makeinfo.c (reader_loop) Paired single quotes turn into double
	quote (outside of fixed-width font insertions.  Multiple dashes
	don't shrink down to double dashes inside of fixed-width font
	insertions.

Sun May 27 11:23:27 1990  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* makeinfo.c Merge in VMS changes.  Adds single change to
	find_and_load (), and mimics some things that SYSV needs for
	headers.

Mon May 21 11:39:43 1990  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* makeinfo.c Added @smallbook.

Thu Apr 26 05:01:04 1990  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* makeinfo.c: Output newline before tag table leader.  @sp X
	doesn't close paragraph anymore, it just acts as if you personally
	typed in X newlines.

Mon Apr 16 02:26:11 1990  Brian Fox  (bfox at gnuwest.fsf.org)

	* makeinfo.c Fixed splitting to output the final node in a
	separate subfile if outputting it in the current subfile would
	make the subfile too large.	

Sun Jan 14 10:34:42 1990  Brian Fox  (bfox at sbphy.ucsb.edu)

	* makeinfo.c: new function normalize_node_name () gets called from
	get_node_token (), get_xref_token (), glean_node_from_menu ().  It
	allows (by hacking) @@ in the name of a node.  This leaves @Top
	undefined as to what action to take: that is to say that @@Top and
	@Top are identical node names.

	* makeinfo.c:begin_insertion ().  Made @example and friends
	sensitive to newlines so that pending_indent wouldn't build up.
	This fixed bug of extra indentation if @example was followed
	immediately by a blank line, instead of text.

Mon Dec 11 11:47:28 1989  Brian Fox  (bfox at rice-chex)

	* Changed cons_string to savestring everywhere.

	* Added info.tar.Z as a target to the Makefile.

	* Makefile: Add rules to link makeinfo with getopt.

Sun Dec 10 01:26:34 1989  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* Makefile: Move default info directory path definition from info.c
	and shorten it, since it will now be changed appropriately for
	each site. 
	Rearrange rules to put those that are likely to be changed locally
	at the beginning.
	Define SHELL, don't define DOC (wasn't used).
	(dist): New rule to make info.tar and info.tar.Z.

	info.c (get_terminal_info): Use fgets instead of gets.
	Flush output before reading.
	(info_signal_handler): Don't declare extra unused args.
	(help_possible_completions): Don't return a value; never used.
	(help_use_info): Ditto.
	(main): Add missing arg to call of get_node.
	(toploop): Ditto.
	(build_notes): Move misplaced ')'.
	Global: Added some casts to function calls.
	Commented out some unused code.

Sat Dec  9 18:44:33 1989  David J. MacKenzie  (djm at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* info.c: Move some function decl's outside of function bodies.
	Include getopt.h.
	(main): Use getopt_long.  Fix error in use of printf.
	Add /usr/local/emacs/info to the default directory path so it
	works at the AI lab.
	(usage): Rename from explain.  Update message.
	(eat_argument): Function removed.

	* Makefile: Add rules for linking info with getopt.
	Rename DOT_OHS macro to OBJECTS.

Tue Nov  7 17:48:31 1989  Richard Stallman  (rms at sugar-bombs.ai.mit.edu)

	* makeinfo.c (CommandTable): Define `@ ' and `@RET'.

Mon Nov  6 08:15:20 1989  Brian Fox  (bfox at rice-chex)

	* makeinfo.c: Added defaulting Next, Prev, and Up pointers in a
	@node command without arguments.  Revamped validation to be more
	robust.  Added new validation rules (see comment at validat_file).
	
	* Changed Makefile to include ChangeLog and default-nodes.texinfo
	in info.tar.Z.

Sun Nov  5 02:27:35 1989  Richard Stallman  (rms at sugar-bombs.ai.mit.edu)

	* makeinfo.c (convert): Split even if errors.

Tue Aug 22 14:51:11 1989  Robert J. Chassell  (bob at hobbes.ai.mit.edu)

	* makeinfo.c (defun_internal): Line that begin with an asterisk
	are mistook for menu entries by info; so, replaced `* ' prior to
	function, variable, etc. definitions with ` * '.

... Aug .. ........ 1989  Brian Fox  (bfox at rice-chex.ai.mit.edu)

	* makeinfo.c: Added the @def... commands.
	Added the -pi flag for paragraph_start_indent.

Wed Jul  6 ........ 1989  Brian Fox  (bfox at rice-chex.ai.mit.edu)

	* info.c: Indirect tags are not assumed to point close to the node.
	Instead, they point to where the node would have been, had the the
	file never been split.  Thus, the header of a split file is
	compensated for, by dynamically figuring out how long it is every
	time we read in a file.

Mon Jun 12 19:48:58 1989  Robert J. Chassell  (bob at rice-chex.ai.mit.edu)

	* makeinfo.c: @result, @expansion, @print, @error, @point, @equiv added

	* makeinfo.c: Make sure that the NEXT node has a PREV that points
	to it.

	* makeinfo.c: Added @result, @expansion, @equiv, @print, @error
	and @point.

	* makeinfo.c (find_index): Fixed comparison to be versus -1.

Fri Apr  7 14:24:27 1989  Randall Smith  (randy at rice-chex.ai.mit.edu)

	* makeinfo.c: Installed new version from bfox.
	* makeinfo.c (get_until): Fixed typo; == should have been =.

... Apr .. ........ 1989  Brian Fox  (bfox at rice-chex.ai.mit.edu)

	* makeinfo.c: Added validation of Up fields.  They now have to
	have a menu item which points to them in the indicated node.

Thu Feb 25 10:22:00 1989  Brian Fox  (bfox at rice-chex.ai.mit.edu)

	* info.c: Made info_directory_paths try to get its value from the
	environment variable INFO_DIRECTORY_PATHS.  Added cons_string
	in an attempt to get rid of the brain-damage (read brian-damage)
	I originally wrote in here.  Death to static limits!

... Oct .. ........ 1988  Brian Fox  (bfox at rice-chex.ai.mit.edu)

	* makeinfo.c: Allowed user defined commands.  In the specific,
	allowed the the user to make his/her own indices.  We define the
	default ones.

Fri Oct  9 13:03:00 1988  Brian Fox  (bfox at rice-chex.ai.mit.edu)

	* info.c: Virgin release 1.0.

	* info.c: Made the completer not use static size variables.
	Also made the completer more generic.  Maybe this will be of
	some use someday.
	Changed file_error to incorporate code suggestions from
	Roland McGrath.
	Changed idiot error messages.  We still need some canonical
	location for the initial Info directory path.

... Jul .. ........ 1988  Brian Fox  (bfox at rice-chex.ai.mit.edu)

	* makeinfo.c: added code to handle un-closed braces at the start
	of a node, un-finished insertions at the start of a node,
	and outputting the `header' at the start of each info split sub-file.

	* makeinfo.c: Made split_file NOT update the tags table to reflect
	the changes in the output files.  This means the reader has also
	changed. 

... Jun .. ........ 1988  Brian Fox  (bfox at rice-chex.ai.mit.edu)

	* makeinfo.c: fixed filling to do the right thing at sentence ends.
	stopped automatically removing filename extensions on output
	split files.

... Apr .. ........ 1988  Brian Fox  (bfox at rice-chex.ai.mit.edu)

	* makeinfo.c: added splitting.
